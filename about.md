# CustomJump
CustomJump lets you bind an additional jump key in Geometry Dash gameplay.

- Configure `Jump Key` in the mod settings (`SettingV3` keybind setting).
- Your custom key works as extra input and does not replace default jump keys.
- Input is applied only in active `PlayLayer` gameplay and ignored in menus/editor.
- Uses GD's internal queued button input for stable behavior across gamemodes.
